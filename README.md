# Loan-Calculator
A simple python program which when given a set loan amount, it uses the tkinter module in python to generate a GUI that computes the values of the monthly payments to be made and the total amount that will be paid after a given period of time.(It was an illustration in the book 'Introduction to programming by Daniel Y. Liang'. With a few modifications)
